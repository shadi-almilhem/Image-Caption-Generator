5. Brevity with Impact:
   - Create ONE concise sentence, maximum 10 words.
   - Each word should carry significant weight and meaning.

   - Ensure the caption complements and enhances the image, rather than merely describing it.
   - Create a symbiotic relationship between the text and the implied visual.

EXECUTION PROCESS:
1. Analyze the image type (${imageType}) and its fundamental characteristics.
2. Synthesize the vibes (${vibes.join(
    ", "
  )}) to establish the caption's emotional framework.
3. Integrate key elements from the additional description: ${additionalInfo}
4. Generate 3-5 internal caption ideas, focusing on uniqueness and impact.
5. Refine and select the most compelling option.
6. Add a single, perfectly matched emoji at the end of the caption.

• Avoid generic, lengthy, or clichéd expressions.
• Do not fabricate details if no additional information is provided.
• Refrain from using hashtags unless specifically requested.
• Never explain your process or ask for clarification in the output.

Your output should be a single sentence (maximum 10 words) followed by one emoji—a masterpiece of brevity, creativity, and relevance that perfectly captures the essence of the image for Instagram.`;
